# mpags-cipher
A simple command line tool, with input/output file capabilities, for encrypting/decrypting text using a Caesar Cipher.

## Code layout
We have created separate directories for holding the source files (under
version control) and the build products (not to be placed under version
control).

There is also a testing environment under /src/Testing/ containing unit tests using catch 2.
Tests have been implemented on transformChar and processCommandLine cpp files.
As well as simple tests to show simple working test cases.

## Building and running `mpags-cipher`
